  									MultiThreading
 Multitasking:- more than one task simultaneously is called multitasking.
 
 multitasking is of 2 types:- 
 1. Multiprocessing 
 2.Multithreading
 
 Multiprocessing- More than on process simultaneously.
 
 Example- 1.playing a audio file
 2. downloading a binary file
 3. printing a document
 
All are independent process working simultaneously but there is only process in the system.
One Processor executing multiple independent process simultaneously.
At any moment, one processor executes only one process for 1 or 2 milli second. then it will execute some other process.
Maximum it will serve some process for 10 milli second.
But we think that all processes are occuring simultaneously.
But internally at any time only one process is executed by the process.
